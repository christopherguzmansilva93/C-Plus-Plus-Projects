/*from book) An employee is paid at a rate of $16.78 per hour for regular hours worked in a week. Any
hours over that are paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times that. From the worker’s gross
pay, 6% is withheld for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for federal income tax, 5% is withheld for
state income tax, and $10 per week is withheld for union dues. Write a program that will read in the
number of hours worked in a week and will then output the worker’s gross pay, each withholding
amount, and the net take-home pay for the week.*/
